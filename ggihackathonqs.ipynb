    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "#### Test Case 1:\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- \\( A = 8, B = 11, C = 9 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need the smallest **X** such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "((8 | X) \\& (11 | X)) = 9\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's check with \\( X = 1 \\):\n",
    "  - \\( (8 | 1) = 9 \\)\n",
    "  - \\( (11 | 1) = 11 \\)\n",
    "  - \\( (9 \\& 11) = 9 = C \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the smallest **X** is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Case 2:\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- \\( A = 3, B = 2, C = 1 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no **X** that satisfies the condition, so the output is `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach:**\n",
    "1. **Iterate Over X:**\n",
    "   - Start from `X = 0` and check incrementally.\n",
    "   - Check the condition: \n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     ((A | X) \\& (B | X)) = C\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - If the condition is satisfied, return this value of **X**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimization:**\n",
    "   - Since the maximum value for **A, B, C** is \\(10^9\\), we can limit **X** up to `1024` (i.e., `2^10`), as higher bits wouldn't affect the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge Cases:**\n",
    "   - If no such **X** is found, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Python Solution:**\n",
    "We need to implement the function `Find_X(A, B, C)` in the given template.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def Find_X(A, B, C):\n",
    "    # Try all possible values of X from 0 to 1024\n",
    "    for X in range(1025):\n",
    "        if ((A | X) & (B | X)) == C:\n",

    "    # Calling the function and printing the result\n",
    "    out_ = Find_X(A, B, C)\n",
    "    print(out_)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation of the Code:**\n",
    "1. The function `Find_X(A, B, C)`:\n",
    "   - Loops from `X = 0` to `X = 1024`.\n",
    "   - Checks if `((A | X) & (B | X)) == C`.\n",
    "   - If the condition is met, it returns the value of **X**.\n",
    "   - If no such **X** is found, returns `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Input and Output Handling:\n",
    "   - Reads number of test cases, **T**.\n",
    "   - Loops through each test case, reading values for **A**, **B**, and **C**.\n",
    "   - Calls `Find_X()` for each test case and prints the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Check Up to 1024 for X?**\n",
    "- Since \\( 0 \\leq A, B, C \\leq 10^9 \\), the first 10 bits are most influential.\n",
    "- Values above `1024` don't significantly change the result due to the maximum bit length of \\( 10^9 \\).\n",

    "- **Test Case 1:** \n",
    "  - \\( A = 8, B = 11, C = 9 \\)\n",
    "  - The smallest **X** is `1` because:\n",
    "    - \\( (8 | 1) = 9 \\), \\( (11 | 1) = 11 \\)\n",
    "    - \\( (9 \\& 11) = 9 = C \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test Case 2:**\n",
    "  - \\( A = 3, B = 2, C = 1 \\)\n",
    "  - No **X** satisfies the condition, so the output is `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "  - \\( O(T \\times 1025) \\), where **T** is the number of test cases.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "  - \\( O(1) \\), only using variables for calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Edge Cases to Consider:**\n",
    "1. \\( A, B, C = 0 \\) ‚Üí Should return `0`.\n",
    "2. No valid **X** ‚Üí Should return `-1`.\n",
    "3. \\( A = B = C \\) ‚Üí Should return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why this Solution is Efficient:**\n",
    "- The solution checks up to `1024` values for **X**, ensuring it is fast enough for competitive programming constraints.\n",
    "- It covers all possible scenarios without unnecessary calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "This approach efficiently solves the problem using bitwise operations and limits the search space for **X** using logical constraints. It's optimized for competitive programming scenarios and handles edge cases smoothly."
